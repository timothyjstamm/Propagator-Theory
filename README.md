Numerical Applications of Propagator Theory

Applications of Propagator Theory are multifold, see the pdf for the mathematics. 

In principle it's a continuum generalization of non-linear Neural Networks which is simultaneously equivalent to Physics (quantum and classical) and signal processing theory.

In the simple gaussian propagator files we have infinite neurons processing a signal which is simultaneously equivalent to the diffusion equation.

It is simply applying a Green's function and so this is vastly superior to solving for a host  of boundary conditions etc. Any starting concentration is acceptable here.

...and simultaneously is the application of a Gaussian Blur to an input signal.
